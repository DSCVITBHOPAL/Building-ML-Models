# Building-ML-Models
A fun ML repository where students can create and compare their models on various metrics like accuracy etc.

## What is this repository all about?
* Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
* Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. 
* <b>This repository will help you to master the most basic part of ML; model building. As you create models, you can compare accuracies with other models and inturn, you can improve on your models.</b>

## That sounds great! But how can we contribute?
1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b <name>-<modelName>`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Added my initial model'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin <branch-name>`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## That sounds good! But how will you keep a track of the accuracies?
We would be maintaining a leaderboard, which would keep track of accuracies. 


## So what are you waiting for? Get contributing!
